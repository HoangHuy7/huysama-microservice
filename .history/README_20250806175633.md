# Microservice Huysama Project

A modern, production-grade microservices system designed for scalability, security, and maintainability. This project demonstrates advanced system design, DevOps, and full-stack engineering skills, making it an ideal showcase for professional portfolios and CVs.

---

## üöÄ Overview

**Microservice Huysama** is a comprehensive platform built with a microservices architecture, featuring:
- A powerful, responsive admin panel (React + Vite + TypeScript)
- Secure authentication and authorization service (Spring Boot, Java)
- Robust infrastructure with Traefik, Pomerium, Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube)
- CI/CD pipelines and modern DevOps practices

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is modularized into independent services, each responsible for a specific domain. Communication is secured and managed via API gateway and service mesh. Below is the high-level architecture:

**Key Components:**
- **Admin Panel:** Modern UI for system management
- **Authentication Service:** Centralized, secure user auth
- **API Gateway & Routing:** Traefik, Pomerium for secure ingress, SSO, and service discovery
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized services, Kubernetes-ready, Nginx for static assets
- **CI/CD:** Automated pipelines for build, test, and deployment

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, TypeScript, Ant Design
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes (Minikube), Nginx
- **Networking & Security:** Traefik, Pomerium (Zero Trust, SSO)
- **DevOps:** CI/CD pipelines (see `cicd/`), containerization, orchestration

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Minikube (for local Kubernetes)
- Java (JDK 11+)
- Node.js & pnpm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd microservice-huysama
   ```
2. **Backend Setup (Spring Boot):**
   ```bash
   cd springbootmca
   mvn clean install
   cd ..
   ```
3. **Frontend Setup (Admin Panel):**
   ```bash
   cd microservice-huysama-admin-panel
   pnpm install
   cd ..
   ```
4. **Start all services (Docker Compose):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
